Welcome to the Kubeasy Developer Guide!

This guide will walk you through the process of creating new challenges for Kubeasy. Whether you're contributing to the official challenge repository or building custom challenges for your team, this guide covers everything you need to know.

## What is a challenge?

A Kubeasy challenge is a **self-contained, broken Kubernetes scenario** that learners must fix.

Each challenge consists of:
- **Initial manifests** - The broken or incomplete Kubernetes resources
- **Validation rules** - Criteria that define what "solved" means
- **Metadata** - Title, description, difficulty, estimated time
- **Documentation** - Context and learning objectives (optional)

## Quick overview

Creating a challenge involves:

1. **Design the scenario** - Identify a realistic Kubernetes problem to teach
2. **Write the manifests** - Create the broken initial state
3. **Define validation** - Specify what "fixed" looks like
4. **Test locally** - Ensure the challenge works as expected
5. **Submit** - Open a pull request to the challenges repository

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for:

- **Contributors** who want to add new challenges to Kubeasy
- **Educators** building custom learning paths for their teams
- **Kubernetes experts** who want to share their experience through practical scenarios

You should have:
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts
- Experience writing Kubernetes manifests
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub
