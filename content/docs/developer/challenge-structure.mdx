description: Understanding the anatomy of a Kubeasy challenge and how all components work together.
---

Every Kubeasy challenge follows a consistent structure. This page explains each component and how they work together.

## Directory Structure

Each challenge is a folder in the [`challenges` repository](https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/challenges):

```
challenges/
└── pod-evicted/
    ├── challenge.yaml      # Metadata, description, AND validations
    ├── manifests/          # Initial broken state
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── service.yaml
    │   └── ...
    ├── policies/           # Kyverno policies (prevent bypasses)
    │   └── protect.yaml
    └── image/              # Optional: custom Docker images
        └── Dockerfile
```

## Components

### 1. challenge.yaml

The `challenge.yaml` file contains **everything** about the challenge: metadata, description, and validations.

```yaml
title: Pod Evicted
description: |
  A data processing pod keeps crashing and getting evicted.
  It was working fine yesterday, but now Kubernetes keeps killing it.

theme: resources-scaling
difficulty: easy
estimated_time: 15

initial_situation: |
  A data processing application is deployed as a single pod.
  The pod starts successfully but after a few seconds gets killed.
  It enters a CrashLoopBackOff state and keeps restarting.

objective: |
  Fix the pod so it can run without being evicted.
  Understand why Kubernetes is killing the application.

validations:
  - key: pod-running
    title: "Pod Ready"
    description: "The pod must be running and healthy"
    order: 1
    type: status
    spec:
      target:
        kind: Pod
        labelSelector:
          app: data-processor
      conditions:
        - type: Ready
          status: "True"
```

#### Metadata Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | Challenge name (shown in UI) |
| `description` | Yes | Brief description of symptoms (NOT the cause!) |
| `theme` | Yes | Category for grouping |
| `difficulty` | Yes | `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` |
| `estimated_time` | Yes | Minutes to complete |
| `initial_situation` | Yes | What the user will find |
| `objective` | Yes | What needs to be achieved |
| `validations` | Yes | Success criteria (see below) |

#### Writing Good Descriptions

**Describe symptoms, not causes:**

```yaml
# BAD - Reveals the problem
description: |
  The ConfigMap has invalid JSON syntax.
  Fix the JSON formatting error.

# GOOD - Maintains mystery
description: |
  A microservice keeps crashing shortly after deployment.
  The team swears the code hasn't changed.
```

**State goals, not methods:**

```yaml
# BAD - Tells user what to do
objective: |
  Increase the memory limit to 256Mi.

# GOOD - States the outcome
objective: |
  Make the pod run stably without being evicted.
```

### 2. manifests/ Directory

Contains the **initial broken state** - Kubernetes resources that learners need to fix.

```yaml
# manifests/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: data-processor
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: data-processor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: data-processor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: processor
        image: kubeasy/data-processor:v1
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "32Mi"  # BUG: Too low!
            cpu: "100m"
```

**Design principles:**

- **Keep it minimal** - Only include what's needed
- **Make it realistic** - Mirror production problems
- **One problem at a time** - Don't combine unrelated issues
- **Clear naming** - Be descriptive

### 3. policies/ Directory

Kyverno policies that **prevent bypasses** - stopping users from cheating instead of solving the challenge properly.

```yaml
# policies/protect.yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: protect-data-processor
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: preserve-image
      match:
        resources:
          kinds: ["Deployment"]
          names: ["data-processor"]
          namespaces: ["challenge-*"]
      validate:
        message: "Cannot change the application image"
        pattern:
          spec:
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                  - name: processor
                    image: "kubeasy/data-processor:v1"
```

**What to protect:**

- Container images (prevent replacing the app)
- Critical volume mounts
- Essential labels (ensure validations can find resources)

**What NOT to protect:**

- Resource limits/requests (user should be able to change these)
- Environment variables
- Probe configurations
- Labels and annotations

### 4. Validations

Defined in `challenge.yaml`, validations determine when the challenge is solved.

```yaml
validations:
  - key: unique-identifier
    title: "User-Friendly Title"
    description: "What this checks"
    order: 1
    type: status|log|event|metrics|rbac|connectivity
    spec:
      # Type-specific configuration
```

**Available types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `status` | Check resource conditions (Ready, Available) |
| `log` | Find strings in container logs |
| `event` | Detect forbidden K8s events (OOMKilled, Evicted) |
| `metrics` | Check pod metrics (restart count) |
| `rbac` | Test ServiceAccount permissions |
| `connectivity` | HTTP connectivity tests |

See [Validation Rules](/docs/developer/validation-rules) for detailed examples.

### 5. image/ Directory (Optional)

If your challenge needs a custom application, you can create your own Docker image. Simply add an `image/` directory with a `Dockerfile` in your challenge folder:

```
my-challenge/
├── challenge.yaml
├── manifests/
├── policies/
└── image/
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── app.py          # Your application files
```

**Example Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# image/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

COPY app.py /app/
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]
```

#### Automatic Build & Publish

When you merge your challenge to `main`, the CI automatically:

1. Detects challenges with an `image/` directory
2. Builds the Docker image (multi-arch: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`)
3. Pushes to GitHub Container Registry: `ghcr.io/kubeasy-dev/<challenge-name>:latest`

**Using your custom image in manifests:**

```yaml
# manifests/deployment.yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: ghcr.io/kubeasy-dev/my-challenge:latest
```

#### When to Use Custom Images

- Your challenge needs specific application behavior (memory leaks, slow responses, etc.)
- You need to simulate a realistic application workload
- Standard images (nginx, python, busybox) don't fit your scenario

#### Best Practices

- Keep images small (use slim/alpine base images)
- Don't include secrets or sensitive data
- Make the application behavior predictable and reproducible
- Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files

## Themes

Challenges are grouped by theme:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `rbac-security` | Permissions, roles, security contexts |
| `networking` | Services, ingress, network policies |
| `volumes-secrets` | Storage, ConfigMaps, Secrets |
| `resources-scaling` | Limits, requests, HPA, scaling |
| `monitoring-debugging` | Probes, logging, events |

## How It All Works Together

1. **User starts challenge** (`kubeasy challenge start pod-evicted`)
   - CLI creates ArgoCD Application pointing to `manifests/`
   - ArgoCD deploys resources to dedicated namespace
   - Kyverno policies are applied

2. **User investigates and fixes**
   - Uses `kubectl` to explore the problem
   - Modifies resources to fix the issue
   - Kyverno validates changes (prevents bypasses)

3. **User submits solution** (`kubeasy challenge submit pod-evicted`)
   - CLI loads validations from `challenge.yaml`
   - Executes each validation against the cluster
   - Sends results to backend
   - XP awarded if all validations pass

## Best Practices

### Challenge Design

- **One concept per challenge** - Don't mix RBAC + networking + storage
- **Realistic scenarios** - Use problems that occur in production
- **Clear error messages** - When users check logs, they should see helpful errors
- **No red herrings** - Don't add confusing complexity

### Validation Design

- **Check outcomes, not implementations** - "Pod is healthy" not "Memory is 256Mi"
- **Don't reveal solutions** - Validation titles should be generic
- **Accept multiple solutions** - If there are valid alternatives, allow them

### Documentation

- **Describe symptoms** - Not the root cause
- **State goals** - Not the method to achieve them
- **Never include solutions** - Let users figure it out
