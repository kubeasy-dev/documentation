description: How to define success criteria for challenges using the CLI-based validation system.
---

Validation rules define when a challenge is considered "solved". Kubeasy uses a **CLI-based validation system** where validations are defined in `challenge.yaml` and executed directly against the Kubernetes cluster.

## Philosophy: Validate Outcomes, Not Implementations

The key principle of Kubeasy validations is to **check that the problem is fixed**, not how it was fixed.

**Bad validation** (reveals the solution):
```yaml
- key: memory-limit-fixed
  title: "Memory Limit Set to 256Mi"
  description: "Container memory limit must be 256Mi"
```

**Good validation** (checks outcome):
```yaml
- key: stable-operation
  title: "Stable Operation"
  description: "Pod must run without crashing"
```

This allows multiple valid solutions and doesn't spoil the learning experience.

## Validation Types

| Type | Purpose | Example Use Case |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `condition` | Check Kubernetes conditions | Pod Ready, Deployment Available |
| `status` | Check resource status fields with operators | replicas >= 3, restartCount < 5 |
| `log` | Find strings in container logs | "Connected to database", "Server started" |
| `event` | Detect forbidden K8s events | No OOMKilled, no CrashLoopBackOff |
| `connectivity` | HTTP connectivity tests | Service responds with 200 |

## Defining Validations

All validations are defined in the `validations` section of `challenge.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Pod Evicted
description: |
  A pod keeps crashing...
# ... other metadata

validations:
  - key: unique-identifier
    title: "User-Friendly Title"
    description: "What this checks (not how to fix it)"
    order: 1
    type: condition
    spec:
      # Type-specific configuration
```

### Common Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | Yes | Unique identifier for this validation |
| `title` | Yes | Short title shown in the UI |
| `description` | Yes | What this validation checks |
| `order` | No | Display order (lower = first) |
| `type` | Yes | One of: condition, status, log, event, connectivity |
| `spec` | Yes | Type-specific configuration |

## Validation Examples

### Condition Validation

Check if a resource has specific conditions (Ready, Available, etc.). This is the most common validation type.

```yaml
- key: pod-ready-check
  title: "Pod Ready"
  description: "The application pod must be running and healthy"
  order: 1
  type: condition
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Pod
      labelSelector:
        app: my-app
    checks:
      - type: Ready
        status: "True"
```

**For Deployments:**

```yaml
- key: deployment-available
  title: "Deployment Available"
  description: "All replicas must be available"
  order: 1
  type: condition
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-deployment
    checks:
      - type: Available
        status: "True"
```

### Status Validation

Check resource status fields using comparison operators. Useful for numeric values.

```yaml
- key: low-restarts
  title: "Stable Operation"
  description: "Pod must not restart excessively"
  order: 2
  type: status
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Pod
      labelSelector:
        app: my-app
    checks:
      - field: "containerStatuses[0].restartCount"
        operator: "<"
        value: 3
```

**Available operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

**Check replicas:**
```yaml
- key: replicas-ready
  title: "All Replicas Ready"
  description: "Deployment must have all replicas"
  type: status
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-deployment
    checks:
      - field: "readyReplicas"
        operator: ">="
        value: 3
```

### Log Validation

Find expected strings in container logs.

```yaml
- key: database-connection
  title: "Database Connected"
  description: "The application must connect to the database"
  order: 2
  type: log
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Pod
      labelSelector:
        app: api-service
    expectedStrings:
      - "Connected to database successfully"
    sinceSeconds: 120
```

**With specific container:**

```yaml
- key: sidecar-logs
  title: "Sidecar Running"
  description: "The sidecar container must be logging"
  type: log
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Pod
      labelSelector:
        app: my-app
    container: sidecar
    expectedStrings:
      - "Sidecar initialized"
    sinceSeconds: 60
```

### Event Validation

Detect forbidden Kubernetes events (useful for checking stability).

```yaml
- key: no-crashes
  title: "No Crash Events"
  description: "The pod should not experience crashes or evictions"
  order: 3
  type: event
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Pod
      labelSelector:
        app: data-processor
    forbiddenReasons:
      - "OOMKilled"
      - "Evicted"
      - "CrashLoopBackOff"
      - "FailedScheduling"
    sinceSeconds: 300
```

### Connectivity Validation

Test HTTP connectivity between pods.

```yaml
- key: service-reachable
  title: "Service Connectivity"
  description: "The backend must be reachable"
  order: 4
  type: connectivity
  spec:
    sourcePod:
      labelSelector:
        app: client
    targets:
      - url: "http://backend-service:8080/health"
        expectedStatusCode: 200
        timeoutSeconds: 5
```

**With custom headers (useful for Ingress testing):**

```yaml
- key: ingress-routing
  title: "Ingress Routing"
  description: "Traffic must route through ingress"
  type: connectivity
  spec:
    sourcePod:
      labelSelector:
        app: client
    targets:
      - url: "http://ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local"
        headers:
          Host: "api.local"
        expectedStatusCode: 200
        timeoutSeconds: 5
```

## Kyverno Policies

Kyverno policies prevent users from **bypassing the challenge** (e.g., replacing the broken app with a working one).

### What to Protect

- **Container images** - Prevent replacing the application
- **Critical volume mounts** - Prevent removing problematic configs
- **Essential labels** - Ensure validations can find resources

### Example Policy

```yaml
# policies/protect.yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: protect-challenge-image
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: preserve-image
      match:
        resources:
          kinds: ["Deployment"]
          names: ["my-app"]
          namespaces: ["challenge-*"]
      validate:
        message: "Cannot change the application image"
        pattern:
          spec:
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                  - name: app
                    image: "kubeasy/broken-app:v1"
```

### What NOT to Protect

Users should be free to:
- Modify resource limits/requests
- Add environment variables
- Change probe configurations
- Add/modify labels and annotations
- Scale deployments

## Complete Example

Here's a complete `challenge.yaml` with multiple validations:

```yaml
title: Pod Evicted
description: |
  A data processing pod keeps crashing and getting evicted.
  It was working fine yesterday, but now Kubernetes keeps killing it.
theme: resources-scaling
difficulty: easy
estimated_time: 15
initial_situation: |
  A data processing application is deployed as a single pod.
  The pod starts successfully but after a few seconds gets killed.
  It enters a CrashLoopBackOff state and keeps restarting.
objective: |
  Fix the pod so it can run without being evicted.
  Understand why Kubernetes is killing the application.

validations:
  - key: pod-running
    title: "Pod Ready"
    description: "The data-processor pod must be running and healthy"
    order: 1
    type: condition
    spec:
      target:
        kind: Pod
        labelSelector:
          app: data-processor
      checks:
        - type: Ready
          status: "True"

  - key: no-eviction
    title: "No Crash Events"
    description: "The pod should run stably without being killed"
    order: 2
    type: event
    spec:
      target:
        kind: Pod
        labelSelector:
          app: data-processor
      forbiddenReasons:
        - "Evicted"
        - "OOMKilled"
      sinceSeconds: 300

  - key: low-restarts
    title: "Stable Operation"
    description: "The pod must not restart excessively"
    order: 3
    type: status
    spec:
      target:
        kind: Pod
        labelSelector:
          app: data-processor
      checks:
        - field: "containerStatuses[0].restartCount"
          operator: "<"
          value: 3
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't reveal the solution in validation titles

```yaml
# BAD
- key: memory-limit
  title: "Memory Limit Increased to 256Mi"

# GOOD
- key: stable-operation
  title: "Stable Operation"
```

### Don't be too specific about implementation

```yaml
# BAD
- key: probe-check
  title: "Liveness Probe Uses /healthz Endpoint"

# GOOD
- key: health-checks
  title: "Health Checks Pass"
```

### Don't check implementation details

```yaml
# BAD - Forces specific solution
- key: secret-volume
  title: "Secret Mounted at /etc/credentials"
  type: status
  spec:
    # Checks for specific volume mount path

# GOOD - Checks the app works
- key: authentication
  title: "Application Authenticated"
  type: log
  spec:
    target:
      kind: Pod
      labelSelector:
        app: my-app
    expectedStrings:
      - "Authentication successful"
```

## How Validation Works

1. **User starts challenge** - CLI deploys manifests via ArgoCD
2. **User works on the fix** - Modifies resources with kubectl
3. **User submits** - CLI loads validations from `challenge.yaml`
4. **CLI executes validations** - Runs each check against the cluster
5. **Results sent to backend** - Backend verifies all objectives present
6. **XP awarded** - If all validations pass
