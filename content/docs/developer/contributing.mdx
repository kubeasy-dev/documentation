---

Thank you for contributing to Kubeasy! This guide explains how to submit high-quality challenges that provide a great learning experience.

## Before you start

### Check existing challenges

Browse the [challenges repository](https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/challenges) to:

- Avoid duplicating existing challenges
- Understand the current challenge structure
- Get inspiration from well-designed challenges

### Propose your idea

Before investing time in building a challenge, open a **GitHub Issue** to discuss your idea:

1. Go to [kubeasy-dev/challenges/issues](https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/challenges/issues)
2. Create a new issue with the **"Challenge Proposal"** template
3. Describe:
   - What Kubernetes concept it teaches
   - The broken scenario
   - Why it's valuable to learn
   - Estimated difficulty and time

This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures your challenge aligns with Kubeasy's goals.

## Contribution process

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/challenges.git
cd challenges
```

### 2. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b challenge/<challenge-slug>
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `challenge/rbac-service-account`
- `challenge/network-policy-egress`
- `challenge/pvc-storage-class`

### 3. Build the challenge

Follow the structure described in [Challenge Structure](/docs/developer/challenge-structure) and [Creating Challenges](/docs/developer/creating-challenge).

### 4. Test thoroughly

See [Testing Challenges](/docs/developer/testing-challenges) for comprehensive testing strategies.

Minimum testing requirements:

- [ ] Challenge works on a fresh Kind cluster
- [ ] Problem is reproducible
- [ ] Solution passes all validation checks
- [ ] Validation provides clear feedback
- [ ] Estimated time is accurate

### 5. Commit your changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add challenge: RBAC Service Account Permissions"
```

Follow conventional commit style:
- `feat: Add challenge for network policies`
- `fix: Correct validation timeout in RBAC challenge`
- `docs: Improve README for storage class challenge`

### 6. Push and create a pull request

```bash
git push origin challenge/<challenge-slug>
```

Open a pull request on GitHub using the **"Challenge Submission"** template.

## Pull request requirements

### PR title format

```
Add challenge: <Challenge Title>
```

Examples:
- `Add challenge: Network Policy Debugging`
- `Add challenge: RBAC Service Account`

### PR description template

```markdown
## Challenge: <Challenge Title>

Any special considerations, dependencies, or context.
```

## Challenge quality standards

### Design principles

#### 1. Single focused concept

Good:
> "This challenge teaches how to configure resource requests and limits"

Bad:
> "This challenge teaches resource limits, RBAC, network policies, and storage"

**Guideline**: One clear concept per challenge.

#### 2. Realistic scenarios

Good:
> "A deployment fails because the ServiceAccount lacks permissions to read ConfigMaps"

Bad:
> "A deployment has exactly 3 typos that you must find"

**Guideline**: Mirror real production problems, not artificial puzzles.

#### 3. Appropriate difficulty

Match difficulty to complexity:

- **Beginner**: Single issue, clear error messages, common scenarios
- **Intermediate**: Multiple related issues, requires debugging
- **Advanced**: Complex interactions, subtle issues, production-like

#### 4. Clear learning path

Provide progression:
- Hints that guide without revealing the solution
- Validation feedback that indicates what's missing
- README context that explains the "why"

### Code quality

#### Manifests

```yaml
# Good: Clear, minimal, well-commented
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
  namespace: challenge-rbac-basics
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: web-app-sa  # Lacks permissions
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
```

#### Validation

```yaml
# Good: Specific, descriptive, helpful
- name: pod-running
  type: PodStatus
  description: "Web app pod must be running"
  target:
    selector:
      app: web-app
  expected:
    phase: Running

# Bad: Vague, unhelpful
- name: check1
  type: PodStatus
  description: "Check failed"
```

#### Metadata

```yaml
# Good: Clear objectives and hints
objectives:
  - "Understand ServiceAccount and RBAC"
  - "Debug permission errors"
  - "Create appropriate Role and RoleBinding"

hints:
  - "Check pod logs for permission errors"
  - "Review the ServiceAccount used by the deployment"
  - "Ensure the Role grants necessary API access"

# Bad: Generic or missing
objectives:
  - "Fix the problem"
```

### Documentation

#### README structure

Every challenge should have a README with:

1. **Context**: Why does this problem occur?
2. **The Problem**: What's broken?
3. **Learning Objectives**: What will you understand?
4. **Tips**: How to start investigating
5. **References**: Links to official docs

See [Challenge Structure](/docs/developer/challenge-structure#readme-file-optional) for an example.

## Review process

### What reviewers look for

1. **Correctness**
   - Does the challenge work as described?
   - Is validation accurate?
   - Is the solution correct?

2. **Educational value**
   - Does it teach something useful?
   - Is it appropriate for the stated difficulty?
   - Are objectives clear?

3. **Code quality**
   - Are manifests minimal and clear?
   - Is validation comprehensive?
   - Are error messages helpful?

4. **Testing**
   - Has it been tested on a fresh cluster?
   - Is estimated time accurate?
   - Are edge cases handled?

### Addressing feedback

When reviewers request changes:

1. Make the requested modifications
2. Test again to ensure everything still works
3. Push the changes to your branch
4. Respond to review comments

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback: improve validation messages"
git push origin challenge/<challenge-slug>
```

The PR will automatically update.

## Coding standards

### File naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Be descriptive but concise

```
‚úÖ manifests/deployment.yaml
‚úÖ validation/challenge-validation.yaml
‚ùå Deployment.yaml
‚ùå val.yaml
```

### YAML formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Add comments to explain non-obvious configuration
- Group related resources in the same file with `---` separator

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: challenge-example
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
# ...
```

### Resource naming

Use clear, consistent names:

```yaml
# Good
metadata:
  name: web-app
  labels:
    app: web-app
    component: frontend

# Bad
metadata:
  name: x
  labels:
    app: app1
```

## Common pitfalls

### 1. Challenge is too complex

**Problem**: Trying to teach too many concepts at once.

**Fix**: Split into multiple challenges, each focusing on one concept.

### 2. Validation is flaky

**Problem**: Checks fail intermittently due to timing issues.

**Fix**: Use appropriate timeouts and retry policies:

```yaml
retryPolicy:
  attempts: 10
  delay: 5s
timeout: 60s
```

### 3. Error messages are unclear

**Problem**: Users don't understand what's wrong.

**Fix**: Write descriptive validation messages:

```yaml
description: "Service 'web-app' must be accessible on port 80 from within the cluster"
```

### 4. Estimated time is inaccurate

**Problem**: Challenge takes much longer than stated.

**Fix**: Test with someone unfamiliar with the problem and adjust the estimate.

### 5. Solution has multiple valid approaches

**Problem**: Users solve it differently than expected.

**Fix**: This is good! Either:
- Document all valid approaches in `solution/`
- Make validation flexible enough to accept different solutions

## Best practices

### Design

- Start simple - complexity can be added later
- Focus on one learning objective
- Make the broken state obvious but not trivial
- Provide progressive hints

### Implementation

- Use stable, common images (nginx, busybox, etc.)
- Avoid external dependencies when possible
- Keep resource usage minimal
- Test on a clean cluster

### Documentation

- Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- Link to official Kubernetes documentation
- Provide context for real-world relevance
- Write for beginners, even in advanced challenges
