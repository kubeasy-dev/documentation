Welcome to the **Kubeasy Documentation**!

Kubeasy is an interactive learning platform that helps developers master Kubernetes by solving real-world challenges in a safe, local environment.

## What is Kubeasy?

Kubeasy drops you into broken Kubernetes scenarios — maybe a pod won't start, RBAC is blocking access, or a network policy is too restrictive. Your goal? **Investigate, fix, and validate** using real tools like `kubectl`.

No browser playgrounds. No multiple-choice questions. Just you, your terminal, and realistic problems to solve.

## Documentation sections

## Key features

### Local-first

Everything runs on your machine using Kind. No cloud account needed, no data leaves your system.

### Real Kubernetes

Use `kubectl`, Lens, or any tool you prefer. The challenges run on actual Kubernetes, not a simulation.

### Automated validation

Challenges validate themselves using:
- **Kyverno** - Prevents cheating by blocking invalid shortcuts
- **CLI-based validation** - Checks conditions, status fields, logs, events, and connectivity

### Progressive learning

Challenges range from beginner-friendly RBAC scenarios to advanced multi-component debugging.

## Quick start

### For learners

```bash
# Download the CLI from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/kubeasy-cli/releases

# Login with your API token
kubeasy login

# Setup your local environment
kubeasy setup

# Start a challenge
kubeasy challenge start rbac-basics
```

### For contributors

```bash
# Clone the challenges repository
git clone https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/challenges.git
cd challenges

# Create your challenge
mkdir -p my-challenge/manifests
mkdir -p my-challenge/policies

# Test it
kubeasy setup
kubeasy challenge start my-challenge
```

## Philosophy

Kubeasy believes the best way to learn Kubernetes is through **practice, not theory**. By simulating real issues in isolated environments, you can safely explore, break things, and rebuild — developing a deeper understanding of how Kubernetes actually works.
