Ready to dive into your first Kubernetes challenge with Kubeasy?  
This guide will walk you through the full setup — from prerequisites to your first submission.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (used to run the local Kubernetes cluster) or other container runtime compatible with [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) (used to inspect and interact with your cluster)

## Step-by-step Setup

### 1. Install the Kubeasy CLI

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/kubeasy-cli/releases):

```bash
# macOS (Intel)
curl -LO https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/kubeasy-cli/releases/latest/download/kubeasy-darwin-amd64
chmod +x kubeasy-darwin-amd64
sudo mv kubeasy-darwin-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubeasy

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -LO https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/kubeasy-cli/releases/latest/download/kubeasy-darwin-arm64
chmod +x kubeasy-darwin-arm64
sudo mv kubeasy-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/kubeasy

# Linux
curl -LO https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/kubeasy-cli/releases/latest/download/kubeasy-linux-amd64
chmod +x kubeasy-linux-amd64
sudo mv kubeasy-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubeasy

# Windows (PowerShell)
# Download from https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/kubeasy-cli/releases/latest
# Add the binary to your PATH
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
kubeasy version
```

### 2. Generate your API Token

Go to your Kubeasy profile and generate a personal access token.
This token allows the CLI to fetch available challenges and submit your results.

### 3. Login to Kubeasy

```bash
kubeasy login
```

Paste the token when prompted. You’re now authenticated.

### 4. Set up the local environment

```bash
kubeasy setup
```

This will:

- Create a Kind Kubernetes cluster (if it doesn't exist yet)
- Install required components (validators, policies, etc.)

You only need to run this once on a machine.

### 5. Pick a challenge

Visit the [challenge list](/challenges) and choose one that interests you.
Each challenge comes with a short description, difficulty, and estimated time.

### 6. Start the challenge

```bash
kubeasy challenge start <challenge-name>
```

This command will:

- Apply the initial manifests (representing the broken scenario)
- Create a dedicated namespace for the challenge
- Automatically switch your kubectl context to that namespace

### 7. Play and fix the challenge

Use kubectl, logs, and events to investigate what’s wrong.

You can edit objects, apply new resources, and debug freely — just like in a real cluster.

### 8. Submit your solution

```bash
kubeasy challenge submit <challenge-name>
```

The CLI will:

- Run a series of validations (static and dynamic)
- Upload your submission result to the platform

### 9. Review your submission

Go to the web platform to see:

- Which tests passed or failed
- Helpful messages for failed checks
- Whether the challenge is considered complete

### 10. (optional) Clean up

```bash
kubeasy challenge clean <challenge-name>
```

This removes all resources created for the challenge — including the namespace.

That’s it! You’re ready to start learning Kubernetes by solving real problems.
