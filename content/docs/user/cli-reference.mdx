title: Kubeasy CLI Reference
description: Full reference of all available Kubeasy CLI commands to manage your challenges, cluster, and configuration.
---

The `kubeasy` CLI is the main tool to interact with Kubeasy locally: start challenges, submit solutions, reset environments, and more.

Built with Go and powered by [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/), the CLI is distributed as a single binary with no dependencies.

**Installation:**
See the [Getting Started guide](/user/getting-started) for all installation methods (install script, Homebrew, NPM, Scoop, or manual download).

```bash
kubeasy version
```

## Authentication

### `kubeasy login`

Authenticate the CLI by entering your API key (generated from your [profile page](https://kubeasy.dev/profile)).
The key is stored securely using the best available backend:

1. **System keyring** (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) -- preferred
2. **File-based storage** (`~/.config/kubeasy-cli/credentials`) -- fallback for headless environments

You can also set the `KUBEASY_API_KEY` environment variable for CI/CD use.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy login
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy login
API Key: ************************************
API key stored in system keyring
Welcome John Doe
Login successful!
```

## Setup

### `kubeasy setup`

Prepare your local environment for Kubeasy. This command:

- Creates a local Kind cluster named `kubeasy` (if one doesn't exist)
- Installs Kyverno (policy engine for bypass prevention)
- Installs local-path-provisioner (for PersistentVolume storage)

Usually run once per machine before starting challenges. Requires authentication -- run `kubeasy login` first.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy setup
```

**Example output:**
```
$ kubeasy setup
Kubeasy Environment Setup

Creating kind cluster 'kubeasy' (Kubernetes 1.32)   [12s]
Installing infrastructure (Kyverno + local-path-provisioner)   [45s]

Kubeasy environment is ready!
You can now start challenges with 'kubeasy challenge start <slug>'
```

## Challenge management

All challenge-related actions are available under the `challenge` subcommand.

### `kubeasy challenge get <challenge>`

View details about a specific challenge before starting it.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge get <challenge-slug>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge get pod-evicted

Pod Evicted

Difficulty: easy
Theme: resources-scaling
Slug: pod-evicted

Description:
A data processing pod keeps crashing and getting evicted.
It was working fine yesterday, but now Kubernetes keeps killing it.

Initial Situation:
A data processing application is deployed as a single pod.
The pod starts but keeps crashing after a few seconds.

Objective:
Investigate why the pod keeps crashing and fix it so it runs stably.
```

### `kubeasy challenge start <challenge>`

Start a challenge. This command:

- Creates a dedicated namespace for the challenge
- Pulls the challenge OCI artifact from the registry
- Applies manifests and Kyverno policies
- Waits for resources to be ready
- Switches your `kubectl` context to the challenge namespace

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge start <challenge-slug>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge start pod-evicted
Starting Challenge: pod-evicted

Challenge: Pod Evicted
Fetching challenge details
Checking challenge progress
Creating namespace
Deploying challenge
Kubectl context configured

Challenge environment is ready!
Challenge: pod-evicted
Namespace: pod-evicted
Context: kind-kubeasy
```

**After starting:**
Your kubectl context is now set to the challenge namespace. You can immediately start investigating:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

### `kubeasy challenge submit <challenge>`

Submit your solution for validation.

- Loads validation objectives from the challenge definition
- Executes each validation against the cluster
- Sends results to the Kubeasy platform

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge submit <challenge-slug>
```

**Example (successful submission):**
```
$ kubeasy challenge submit pod-evicted
Submitting Challenge: pod-evicted

Verifying challenge
Checking progress
Loading validations
Running validations...

Condition Validation
  pod-running-check: PASSED - All condition checks passed

Event Validation
  no-crash-events: PASSED - No forbidden events found

Submission Result
All validations passed!
Sending results to server...
Congratulations! Challenge 'pod-evicted' completed!
```

**Example (failed validation):**
```
$ kubeasy challenge submit pod-evicted
Running validations...

Condition Validation
  pod-running-check: FAILED - Condition Ready is False (expected True)

Event Validation
  no-crash-events: FAILED - Found forbidden event: OOMKilled

Submission Result
Some validations failed
Review the results above and try again
```

### `kubeasy challenge reset <challenge>`

Reset the challenge by removing all resources and resetting your progress on the platform.
Use this if you want to start completely fresh.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge reset <challenge-slug>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge reset pod-evicted
Resetting Challenge: pod-evicted

Deleting challenge resources   [5s]
Resetting challenge progress on server

Challenge 'pod-evicted' reset successfully!
You can start the challenge again with 'kubeasy challenge start pod-evicted'
```

### `kubeasy challenge clean <challenge>`

Clean up all Kubernetes resources related to the challenge, including its namespace.
This does **not** reset your challenge progress on the platform.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge clean <challenge-slug>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge clean pod-evicted
Cleaning Challenge: pod-evicted

Deleting challenge resources   [5s]

Challenge 'pod-evicted' cleaned successfully!
All resources have been removed from your cluster
```

**When to use:**
- You've finished the challenge and want to free up resources
- You want to remove challenge resources without resetting your submission
- You're switching to a different challenge

## Dev mode

The `dev` subcommands are designed for **challenge creators**. They let you scaffold, deploy, validate, and iterate on challenges locally — no API login required.

For a complete guide with workflows and examples, see the [Dev Commands Reference](/developer/dev-commands).

### `kubeasy dev create`

Scaffold a new challenge directory with a `challenge.yaml` template and the required folder structure (`manifests/`, `policies/`).

In interactive mode (TTY), prompts guide you through the setup. In non-interactive mode, use flags.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--name` | string | | Challenge name |
| `--slug` | string | | Challenge slug (auto-generated from name if omitted) |
| `--type` | string | | Challenge type (`fix`, `build`, `migrate`) |
| `--theme` | string | | Challenge theme |
| `--difficulty` | string | | Difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) |
| `--estimated-time` | int | `30` | Estimated time in minutes |
| `--with-manifests` | bool | `false` | Generate starter deployment and service manifests |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev create
kubeasy dev create --name "Pod Evicted" --type fix --theme resources-scaling --difficulty easy
```

### `kubeasy dev get`

Display local challenge metadata by reading `challenge.yaml` from the local directory. No cluster or API required.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dir` | string | | Path to challenge directory (default: auto-detect) |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev get
kubeasy dev get --dir ./my-challenge
```

### `kubeasy dev lint`

Validate the structure and content of a `challenge.yaml` file. Checks required fields, valid values, objective structure, and manifests directory. No cluster needed.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dir` | string | | Path to challenge directory (default: auto-detect) |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev lint
kubeasy dev lint --dir ./my-challenge
```

**Example output:**
```
$ kubeasy dev lint
Linting challenge: pod-evicted

✓ All checks passed (0 errors, 0 warnings)
```

### `kubeasy dev apply`

Deploy local challenge manifests to the Kind cluster. This is the dev equivalent of `kubeasy challenge start` but reads from the local filesystem instead of the OCI registry.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dir` | string | | Path to challenge directory (default: auto-detect) |
| `--clean` | bool | `false` | Delete existing resources before applying |
| `--watch`, `-w` | bool | `false` | Watch for file changes and auto-redeploy |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev apply
kubeasy dev apply --clean
kubeasy dev apply --watch
```

### `kubeasy dev validate`

Run challenge validations against the Kind cluster and display results. Does not send results to the API.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dir` | string | | Path to challenge directory (default: auto-detect) |
| `--watch`, `-w` | bool | `false` | Re-run validations every 5 seconds |
| `--fail-fast` | bool | `false` | Stop at the first validation failure |
| `--json` | bool | `false` | Output results as JSON |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev validate
kubeasy dev validate --watch
kubeasy dev validate --fail-fast --json
```

### `kubeasy dev test`

Apply manifests and run validations in one step. Equivalent to `kubeasy dev apply` followed by `kubeasy dev validate`.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dir` | string | | Path to challenge directory (default: auto-detect) |
| `--clean` | bool | `false` | Delete existing resources before applying |
| `--watch`, `-w` | bool | `false` | Re-run validations every 5 seconds after apply |
| `--fail-fast` | bool | `false` | Stop at the first validation failure |
| `--json` | bool | `false` | Output results as JSON |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev test
kubeasy dev test --clean --watch
```

### `kubeasy dev status`

Show pods, recent events, and objective count for a deployed challenge.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dir` | string | | Path to challenge directory (default: auto-detect) |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev status
```

**Example output:**
```
$ kubeasy dev status

Pods
  NAME                      STATUS    READY   RESTARTS   AGE
  data-processor-abc12      Running   1/1     0          2m

Events (last 5m)
  AGE   TYPE     REASON    MESSAGE
  2m    Normal   Pulled    Successfully pulled image "myapp:latest"
  2m    Normal   Started   Started container app

Objectives: 3
```

### `kubeasy dev logs`

Stream logs from pods in the challenge namespace. Attempts to find relevant pods from `challenge.yaml` label selectors, falling back to all pods.

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dir` | string | | Path to challenge directory (default: auto-detect) |
| `--follow`, `-f` | bool | `false` | Follow log output (stream continuously) |
| `--container`, `-c` | string | | Target a specific container |
| `--tail` | int | `50` | Number of recent log lines to show |

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev logs
kubeasy dev logs --follow
kubeasy dev logs --tail 100 --container app
```

### `kubeasy dev clean`

Remove all Kubernetes resources for a dev challenge (deletes the namespace). No API login required.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy dev clean
```

## Shell autocompletion

### `kubeasy completion`

Generate completion scripts for your shell:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish
- PowerShell
