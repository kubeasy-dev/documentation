title: Kubeasy CLI Reference
description: Full reference of all available Kubeasy CLI commands to manage your challenges, cluster, and configuration.
---

The `kubeasy` CLI is the main tool to interact with Kubeasy locally: start challenges, submit solutions, reset environments, and more.

Built with Go and powered by [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/), the CLI is distributed as a single binary with no dependencies.

**Installation:**
Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kubeasy-dev/kubeasy-cli/releases) or see the [Getting Started guide](/docs/user/getting-started) for detailed installation instructions.

```bash
kubeasy version
```

## 🔐 Authentication

### `kubeasy login`

Authenticate the CLI by pasting your personal API token (generated from the [profile page](/profile)).
Your token is stored locally to allow secure access to challenge data and submission features.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy login
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy login
Enter your Kubeasy API token: ************************************
✓ Successfully authenticated as john.doe@example.com
✓ Token saved to ~/.kubeasy/token
```

**Options:**
- `--token <token>` - Provide token via flag instead of interactive prompt

**Example with flag:**
```bash
kubeasy login --token "kb_1234567890abcdef"
```

## ⚙️ Setup

### `kubeasy setup`

Prepare your local environment for Kubeasy. This command:

- Creates a local Kind cluster (if one doesn't exist)
- Installs the required components (validators, policies, etc.)

Usually run once per machine before starting challenges.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy setup
```

**Example output:**
```
$ kubeasy setup
🔍 Checking Docker availability...
✓ Docker is running

🔍 Checking for existing Kind cluster...
⚙️  Creating Kind cluster 'kubeasy'...
✓ Cluster created successfully

📦 Installing ArgoCD...
✓ ArgoCD installed in namespace 'argocd'

📦 Installing Kyverno...
✓ Kyverno installed in namespace 'kyverno'

📦 Installing Challenge Operator...
✓ Operator installed in namespace 'kubeasy-system'

⚙️  Configuring kubectl context...
✓ Context set to 'kind-kubeasy'

✅ Setup complete! You're ready to start challenges.
   Run 'kubeasy challenge start <challenge-name>' to begin.
```

**Options:**
- `--skip-cluster` - Skip cluster creation (use existing cluster)
- `--reset` - Delete and recreate the entire environment

**Troubleshooting:**
If setup fails, check the [Troubleshooting guide](/docs/user/troubleshooting#cluster-setup-issues).

## 🧩 Challenge management

All challenge-related actions are available under the `challenge` subcommand.

### `kubeasy challenge start <challenge>`

Start a challenge. This command:

- Applies the initial manifests into a new dedicated namespace
- Switches your `kubectl` context to that namespace
- Prepares everything to begin solving the problem

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge start <challenge-name>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge start rbac-basics
📥 Fetching challenge metadata...
✓ Challenge 'RBAC Basics: Service Account Permissions' loaded

🚀 Deploying challenge resources...
✓ Namespace 'challenge-rbac-basics' created
✓ ArgoCD Application created
✓ Waiting for resources to sync... (10s)
✓ Resources deployed successfully

⚙️  Switching kubectl context...
✓ Context set to namespace 'challenge-rbac-basics'

🎯 Challenge started!

Objective: Fix the RBAC configuration so the pod can access the API

Estimated time: 15 minutes
Difficulty: Beginner

Hints:
  • Check pod logs for permission errors
  • Review the ServiceAccount used by the deployment
  • Ensure the Role grants necessary API access

Good luck! 🚀
```

**After starting:**
Your kubectl context is now set to the challenge namespace. You can immediately start investigating:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

### `kubeasy challenge submit <challenge>`

Submit your solution for validation.

- Runs all defined static and dynamic checks
- Uploads the results to the Kubeasy platform
- You can then review validation results and feedback via the web interface

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge submit <challenge-name>
```

**Example (successful submission):**
```
$ kubeasy challenge submit rbac-basics
🔍 Running validations...

Static checks (Kyverno):
  ✓ Resource limits defined
  ✓ Security context configured
  ✓ Labels present

Dynamic checks (Operator):
  ✓ Pod is running (phase: Running)
  ✓ Service is accessible (HTTP 200)
  ✓ RBAC permissions granted

📤 Submitting results...
✓ Results uploaded successfully

🎉 Challenge completed! (Score: 100%)

View detailed feedback at:
https://kubeasy.dev/challenges/rbac-basics/submission/abc123
```

**Example (failed validation):**
```
$ kubeasy challenge submit network-policy-debug
🔍 Running validations...

Static checks (Kyverno):
  ✓ NetworkPolicy exists

Dynamic checks (Operator):
  ✓ Pod is running
  ✗ Frontend cannot reach backend (connection timeout)
  ✗ Backend can reach database (should be blocked)

📤 Submitting results...
✓ Results uploaded

❌ Challenge not yet complete (Score: 33%)

Failed checks:
  • Frontend → Backend connectivity
    Expected: Connection successful
    Got: Connection timeout after 5s
    Hint: Check NetworkPolicy ingress rules

  • Backend → Database connectivity
    Expected: Connection blocked
    Got: Connection successful
    Hint: Add egress NetworkPolicy to restrict backend

### `kubeasy challenge get <challenge>`

View details about a specific challenge before starting it.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge get <challenge-name>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge get rbac-basics

╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  RBAC Basics: Service Account Permissions                ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Description:
  A deployment is failing because the ServiceAccount lacks
  permissions to access the Kubernetes API. Fix the RBAC
  configuration to allow the pod to function correctly.

Difficulty: Beginner
Estimated Time: 15 minutes
Theme: RBAC, Security

Learning Objectives:
  • Understand ServiceAccount and RBAC concepts
  • Debug permission errors in pods
  • Create appropriate Role and RoleBinding

Prerequisites:
  • Basic understanding of Kubernetes Pods
  • Familiarity with kubectl commands

Start this challenge:
  kubeasy challenge start rbac-basics
```

### `kubeasy challenge reset <challenge>`

Reset the challenge environment by reapplying the initial manifests. This will also reset your progress and delete your submission on the platform.
Use this if you're stuck or want to start fresh.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge reset <challenge-name>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge reset rbac-basics
⚠️  This will reset the challenge to its initial state.
   Your current progress will be lost.

   Continue? (y/N): y

🔄 Resetting challenge...
✓ Deleted existing resources
✓ Reapplied initial manifests
✓ Challenge reset complete

You can now try solving it again from scratch.
```

**Options:**
- `--force` - Skip confirmation prompt
- `--keep-submission` - Reset cluster resources but keep your submission history

**Example with options:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge reset rbac-basics --force --keep-submission
```

### `kubeasy challenge clean <challenge>`

Clean up all Kubernetes resources related to the challenge, including its namespace.
This does **not** affect your challenge progress on the platform.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubeasy challenge clean <challenge-name>
```

**Example:**
```
$ kubeasy challenge clean rbac-basics
🧹 Cleaning up challenge resources...
✓ Deleted ArgoCD Application
✓ Deleted namespace 'challenge-rbac-basics'
✓ Cleanup complete

Your challenge progress on the platform remains intact.
```

**When to use:**
- You've finished the challenge and want to free up resources
- You want to remove a challenge without resetting your submission
- You're switching to a different challenge

**Clean up all challenges at once:**
```bash
# List all active challenges
kubeasy challenge list --active

# Clean them all
for challenge in $(kubeasy challenge list --active --format=names); do
  kubeasy challenge clean $challenge
done
```

## 🧠 Shell autocompletion

### `kubeasy completion`

Generate completion scripts for your shell:

- Bash
- Zsh
- Fish
- PowerShell

Example:

```bash
kubeasy completion bash | tee -a ~/.bashrc
```

Or for zsh:

```bash
kubeasy completion zsh | tee -a ~/.zshrc
```
